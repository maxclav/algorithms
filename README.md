# Algorithms

Basic algorithms implemented in Go for learning purposes.

## Sort

Basic sorting algorithms implemented in Go to sort slice of int.

If you don't need to learn or implement a specific sorting algorithm, use the [sort package of Go's Standard library](https://pkg.go.dev/sort).

### Test functions

Simply run `make tests`.

### Benchmark the functions

Simply run `make benchmark` and see results.

## Search
